# 3d-environment
Basic 3D environment for python programmed with OpenGL and implenting a Camera class.

Still to be cleaned adn optimized and whatever.

Created with the intention to be a base for other projects (of my own or for whoever wants to use this). I'll be linking projects using this project.
